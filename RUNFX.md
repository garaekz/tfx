# RunFX — Enhanced Implementation Plan

> **Goal:** A robust, efficient, and highly responsive optional runtime loop that precisely manages the terminal (TTY), multiplexes multiple visuals seamlessly, handles graceful degradation for non‑TTY environments, and provides detailed observability and event handling. Explicit mounting of visuals, zero hidden dependencies, and advanced features ensure reliability in complex CLI applications.

---

## Guiding Principles

- **Explicit TTY Ownership**: RunFX exclusively manages terminal rendering, leaving logic orchestration to other packages.
- **Opt-in Runtime**: Components are independently usable; RunFX adds enhanced multiplexed visuals as an explicit choice.
- **Reflection-free & Stateless**: No reflection, global state, or hidden dependencies; strictly maintainable.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Transparent fallback to minimal output when TTY is unavailable.
- **Advanced Robustness**: High concurrency safety, error resilience, and detailed event management.

---

## Stage 0 — Initialization & Core Interfaces

**Tasks**

- Create comprehensive `runfx/` package directory.
- Clear documentation (`doc.go`) outlining the package scope and intent.
- Define explicit, advanced interfaces:

```go
type Visual interface {
    Render(w writer.Writer)
    Tick(now time.Time)
    OnResize(cols, rows int)
}

type Loop interface {
    Mount(v Visual) (unmount func(), err error)
    Run(ctx context.Context) error
    Stop() error
    IsRunning() bool
}
```

**Deliverables**

- Structured, compilable package skeleton with documentation.

---

## Stage 1 — Enhanced TTY & Capability Detection

**Tasks**

- Detailed TTY capability detection leveraging the `terminal` package.
- Dynamic adaptation for true color, ANSI, and no-color environments.
- Non-TTY intelligent fallback (minimal logging, no cursor control).

**Deliverables**

- Robust TTY detection and fallback logic (`tty.go`).

---

## Stage 2 — Comprehensive Cursor & Screen Management

**Tasks**

- Advanced cursor management (visibility, positioning, safe restore).
- Explicit region allocation per visual with dynamic reallocation.
- Optimized screen-clearing logic to reduce flicker.

**Deliverables**

- `cursor.go`, `screen.go`, with comprehensive testing.

---

## Stage 3 — High-performance Event Scheduler

**Tasks**

- Configurable tick scheduler for high-performance animation (30–120 ms).
- Tick management to avoid redundant rendering.
- Efficient visual update handling using dirty state flags.

**Deliverables**

- Highly optimized event loop (`loop.go`).

---

## Stage 4 — Robust Signal & Resize Handling

**Tasks**

- Advanced handling of `SIGWINCH` (resize) with dynamic layout recalculations.
- Context-aware cancellation with safe termination on `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`.
- Integrated event hooks for user-defined resize/cancel handlers.

**Deliverables**

- Signal and event management (`signals.go`).

---

## Stage 5 — Intelligent Multiplexing Engine

**Tasks**

- Thread-safe, mutex-protected visual management.
- Efficient visual mounting/unmounting with safe concurrent operations.
- Dynamic gap management to reuse screen space efficiently.

**Deliverables**

- Intelligent multiplexing logic (`mux.go`).

---

## Stage 6 — Advanced Writer Integration & Double Buffering

**Tasks**

- High-performance writer integration using `writer.ConsoleWriter`.
- Double-buffering implementation for flicker-free rendering.
- Intelligent diffing algorithm to minimize unnecessary writes.

**Deliverables**

- Optimized rendering engine (`render.go`).

---

## Stage 7 — Robust Testing & Concurrency Safety

**Tasks**

- Comprehensive unit tests for visual multiplexing and concurrency.
- Golden tests demonstrating stability under load and concurrency.
- Extensive race-condition testing (`go test -race ./runfx`).

**Deliverables**

- Extensive test suite (`loop_test.go`, `mux_test.go`).

---

## Stage 8 — Detailed Examples & Documentation

**Tasks**

- Provide comprehensive, runnable examples:

  - Parallel downloads with multiple progress bars.
  - Complex visual multiplexing with resizing and cancellation.

- Detailed package-level documentation and usage snippets.

**Deliverables**

- Rich examples (`examples/`) clearly demonstrating advanced use-cases.

---

## Stage 9 — Observability & Debugging Enhancements

**Tasks**

- Integrate structured logging for internal operations (mounting/unmounting, rendering events).
- Provide debug mode with verbose terminal state logging.
- Structured error handling (`ErrLoopClosed`, `ErrMountFailed`, etc.).

**Deliverables**

- Enhanced logging and debugging tools (`logging.go`, `errors.go`).

---

## Stage 10 — API Stability, Versioning & Release

**Tasks**

- Final API audit and stability guarantees (minimal, explicit public API).
- Document API lifecycle, guarantees, and error handling thoroughly.
- Tag initial stable release (`v0.x`).

**Deliverables**

- Versioned release with `CHANGELOG.md`, clear release notes.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Explicit, documented TTY ownership with advanced multiplexing.
- Efficient rendering without flicker or visual overlaps.
- Reliable resizing, signal handling, and graceful shutdowns.
- Zero hidden cross-dependencies with `flowfx`, `formfx`, or `progress`.
- Comprehensive test coverage and passing CI checks (race, lint, vet).
- Highly detailed, runnable documentation and examples.
- Transparent fallback behavior ensuring reliable CLI operations in any environment.
