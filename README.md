# TFX

> Elegant terminal effects & structured output for Go CLIs — composable, fast, and developer-first.

---

## ✨ What is TFX?

**TFX → TermFX** (short for _Terminal Effects_) is a modular Go toolkit for building expressive, styled, and structured terminal output — without the verbosity and fragmentation of typical Go terminal libraries.

It is _not_ a TUI framework. It is a low-friction, highly composable set of tools for CLIs and utilities that need more than just `fmt.Println`, but less than `bubbletea`.

## 🤔 When should you use TFX?

| Tool          | Use Case                               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `fmt.Println` | You don’t care about styling/logging   |
| `log/slog`    | You want structured logs, no styling   |
| `TFX`         | You want structure _and_ style ✨      |
| `bubbletea`   | You’re building a full interactive TUI |

## 🧠 TFX Principles

- 💎 _Multi-path API_: same engine, multiple ways to use it.
- 🚫 _No reflection, no runtime surprises_.
- 🧰 _Structured logs with color and context_.
- 🧪 _Built for testing_: capture logs, inject writers.
- 🎨 _Themeable by design_: ANSI + semantic palettes.
- 🧱 _Minimal dependencies_: No third-party bloat.

---

## 🔥 Features

- Unified color system with support for:

  - ANSI
  - 256-color
  - TrueColor (24-bit)
  - Semantic palettes & themes (Dracula, Nord, GitHub, Tailwind)

- Structured logging with:

  - Badge-style tags (\[INFO], \[ERR], etc)
  - Contextual fields
  - Multi-writer support (console + file rotation)
  - JSON, text, and badge formats

- Terminal capability detection:

  - Per-OS fallbacks
  - Unicode/ANSI support
  - CI-awareness, `NO_COLOR`, etc

- Progress bars and spinners with smart rendering
- Internal `share/` helpers: `OptionSet`, `Overload` (standardized pattern)

| `logfx/`          | Structured, badge-style logging with writers              |
| `progress/`       | Spinners and progress bars with auto-capability rendering |
| `writers/`        | Console & file writers with rotation and theming          |
| `internal/share/` | Internal DX helpers (option sets, overloads, conventions) |

## 🚀 Quickstart

```go
import "github.com/garaekz/tfx/logfx"

func main() {
    logfx.Success("Server started on port %d", 8080)
    logfx.Badge("DB", "Connected to postgres", color.MaterialGreen)
}
```

Use a spinner:

```go
import "github.com/garaekz/tfx/progress"

spinner := progress.NewSpinner("Loading data...")
spinner.Start()
// do something...
spinner.Success("Data loaded!")
```

## 🖼️ Live Preview

See TFX in action with the interactive demo:

```bash
# Build and run the demo
make demo

# Or run specific demonstrations
./bin/demo progress    # Progress bars showcase
./bin/demo color       # Color system showcase
./bin/demo spinner     # Spinners showcase
./bin/demo multipath   # Multipath API showcase
./bin/demo all         # Run all demonstrations
```

## 🧱 Philosophy

> "If there's only one way to use it, it's not the right way."

TFX promotes a **multi-entry design** for each API:

```go
logfx.Success("Done!")                            // 1. Quick default
logger := logfx.New(...)
logger.WithFields(...).Info("custom")            // 2. Instantiated style
logfx.If(err).As(logfx.WARN).Msg("warn msg")       // 3. DSL / fluent
```

This consistency is achieved via internal helpers like `Overload()` and `Option[T]`.
